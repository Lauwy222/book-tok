# Chapter Five: She Stood There

I was in the garage with a few friends, hands deep in the guts of an engine, when my phone rang.  
A friend’s voice on the other end—urgent, almost amused.  
*"Come outside. Now."*  

I stepped out, wiping the grease from my hands.  
And there she was.  

It hit me like a punch.  
The world thinned, sounds muffled.  
For a second, I wasn’t sure my legs would hold me.  

I walked to her slowly, my pulse drumming in my ears.  
I didn’t know whether to speak or just stand there and take her in.  
I pulled her into a hug—warm, brief, charged—and without another word, we went for a drive.  

I misbehaved a little on the road, testing the limits, watching how she reacted.  
The sun sank lower, shadows stretching long.  
The darker it got, the heavier the air felt between us.  

At first, she was shy, quiet, almost guarded.  
But I took her to the beach, where the night wind tangled in her hair.  
We walked along the shore, the tide whispering secrets.  
And then she started talking—really talking.  
I listened to every word like it was oxygen.  

The cold eventually caught her.  
I told her we should go back to the car.  

I opened the door for her, leaning in just enough to fasten her seatbelt.  
Her eyes met mine, and her breath stuttered—  
soft, quick, giving her away.  

We drove again, music spilling from the speakers, our laughter tangling with the wind.  
For a while, it felt like we were the only two people in the world.  

And then—  
the headlights caught familiar shapes.  
Friends.  
The night wasn’t ours anymore.
