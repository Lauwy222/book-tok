# Chapter Two: I followed him

I noticed him first—before the name meant anything, before the face became a habit.  
Not an accident. A choice.

One of his friends talked to me in passing.  
He offered other names, other profiles, a carousel of maybes.  
I barely looked.  
I wanted **him**.  
*How do I make him mine?*

I hovered over the button longer than I should have.  
Then I tapped it.  
`INSTAGRAM: FOLLOWING.`  
I imagined the blue light touching his skin, my name slipping into his night. 

The reply came—a follow back—fast enough to make my breath stumble. I didn't expect it this fast.

His gallery wasn’t modest.  
Engines split open like hearts; asphalt blurred to a ribbon.  

He lived where adrenaline silenced his thoughts.
When I finally got a clear look at his profile, it was simple:  
I need this one. I want him.  
*How do I make him mine?*

But would he want me with the same hunger, or would he just use me?

He messaged first.  
I answered before the dots could even fade.

Our text messages were funny, he had the same humor as me.
Suddenly our conversation shifted. We started flirting.

I caught myself smiling at a screen, the room quiet enough to hear the thud of my own pulse.  
Not just curiosity. Gravity.

Maybe I'm not his type. 
Or maybe I am...

It wasn’t about if he’d follow.  
It was about what would happen next.
