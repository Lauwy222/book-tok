# Chapter One: A New Follower

She’d been watching me long before I ever knew her name.  
A shadow in my orbit.  
A patient ghost.  

I didn’t feel her eyes at first.
But she was there.  
Always there.  

The notification came like a whisper at midnight.  
`INSTAGRAM: New follower.`  

Curiosity tugged.  
*Who’s this?*  

I searched her name, tracing the threads of her existence through Google. 
I found some family snapshots and old photographs.  
Ordinary… at first glance.  
But ordinary never follows me for long.  

I followed her back.  
She accepted almost instantly.  

Her account was a mirror.
I didn’t expect it to.
Cars. Motorcycles. Adrenaline laced into every pixel.  
She liked the same adrenaline rush and chaos I did.  
That meant something. I felt a weird connection

I sent her a message—casual enough to hide the flicker of intrigue beneath it.  
She replied before I could set my phone down.  

The conversation bloomed quickly.  
Memes at first. Harmless.  
But then—ones with edges.  
Twisted humor, sharp and intimate.  
She didn’t just flirt with boundaries—she treated them like speed bumps.  

I caught myself smiling in the dark.  

Maybe she *was* that kind of girl.  
The kind who didn’t just talk about craving the rush—  
she’d take the wheel, press her foot down, and dare you to hold on.  

The question wasn’t whether I’d find out.  
It was how far she’d let me go.
