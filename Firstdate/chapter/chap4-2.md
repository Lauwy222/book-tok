# Chapter Four: A Weird Idea

We’d been talking for half an hour when it hit me—  
I *needed* this girl in my life.  
Not wanted.  
Needed.  

The thought curled through my mind like smoke:  
*How do I make her fall for me?*  

A dangerous answer whispered back.  
I could find her.  
Take her.  
Keep her.  

The idea was sharp, intoxicating, and insane.  
I laughed it off.  
*No… that’s too much.*  
Right?  

But another thought bled in—  
If she was my soulmate, she’d be just as crazy as I was.  
So I had to test her.  

I typed the words before I could second-guess them:  
**Will you go to Paris with me?**  

Her reply came instantly:  
**Fuck yes, why not.**  

My pulse kicked.  
But when I asked if she was serious, hesitation crept in.  
She needed to ask her friends.  
She didn’t ask.  

Every hour she delayed was a thread pulling tighter around my patience.  
The thought of some other man taking her out—touching her—  
It made my blood run like fire.  
I wanted to know where she was.  
I wanted to find her.  

That evening, she finally asked her friends.  
They told her to go.  

Inside, I was chaos—electric, feral—but I kept my voice steady.  
Cool. Collected.  

Paris would be crowded that weekend.  
Too many eyes, too many distractions.  
So we changed course.  

Lille.  
Smaller.  
Quieter.  
Easier to disappear.
