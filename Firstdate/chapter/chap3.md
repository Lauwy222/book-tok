# Chapter Three: The First Picture

It happened without warning.  

Her name lit up my phone, and there it was—  
a picture.  

I stared at it, my pulse shattering into chaos.  
Something low in my stomach tightened, hot and electric.  
My heart pounded so hard it felt like it was trying to escape my chest.  
I had never felt this before.  
Not like this.  

Five minutes slipped away before I realized I hadn’t replied.  
What was she thinking?  
That I was some creep?  
That I didn’t want her?  

No.  
That wasn’t the truth.  
The truth was—  
I wanted too much, too quickly. Too much. Dangerously. 

I opened the camera.  
Framed myself in the lens.  
Took a single shot.  
Sent it.  

Then I waited.  
And waited.  
And—  

She opened it.  
My chest tightened.  
I waited for a reply, for her face, for something.  
Two minutes passed.  
Nothing.  

I sighed, telling myself to let it go, sliding my phone face-down on the table.  
But the second I did—  

**BUZZ.**  

Her name again.  
A new picture.  

This one…  
God.  
It was worse—no, better—than the first.  
Sharper. Softer.  
Danger wrapped in beauty.  

And that’s when I knew.  
I wasn’t just curious anymore.  
I was getting obsessed.  
Hopelessly.
