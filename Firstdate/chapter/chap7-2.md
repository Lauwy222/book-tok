# Chapter Seven: Her Departure

It had been too long.  
Too many nights pacing my room, replaying his words, wondering if the next time I saw him would still feel like fire.  

When I heard the bell and my father’s voice greeting someone outside, my stomach dropped.  
It was him.  
Of course it was him.  

I stayed upstairs too long, listening to the low hum of conversation, trying to steady myself.  
Then my mother’s voice cut through, and I had no more excuses.  

I stepped into view.  
And there he was.  

The way he looked at me nearly undid me.  
Like he was burning alive just by seeing me again.  
When he hugged me, it felt like a claim.  
When he took my suitcases, it felt like a vow.  

We drove.  
I held the wheel, pretending control, but inside I was breaking apart.  
The music made it easier to laugh, to act casual, though I felt his eyes on me constantly.  
Like he was memorizing how I moved, how I breathed.  

Then his hand slid lower.  
Dangerously lower.  
And I didn’t stop him.  
I didn't want him to stop.

The road blurred.  
My focus split between the white lines ahead and the warmth spreading through my body.  
I moaned his name, and the sound scared me—it was too raw, too desperate.  
It just happened.  
I knew by the way he kept going, the way his hunger pressed against my skin.  

It was reckless.  
It was dangerous.  
It was ours.  

By the time we reached Lille, I wasn’t nervous anymore.  
I knew something else instead:  
I wanted him.  
Not just for this drive, not just for this trip.  

I wanted him in a way that felt inevitable.  
In a way that felt like ruin.  
In a way I would never let go.
