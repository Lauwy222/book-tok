# Chapter Six: The Way She Breathes

The night led us to an empty parking lot,  
a place stripped of sound, where shadows clung to metal and glass.  

We moved to the back of my car.  
Her nearness was a kind of gravity—inevitable, undeniable.  
I pulled her close, arms circling her, my hands lingering at the base of her neck.  
Tension sparked like a live wire between us.  

She looked at me.  
I looked at her.  
Closer.  
Closer still.  

Her breath brushed against my lips—warm, uneven, trembling.  
Butterflies tore wild inside me, reckless wings battering against my ribs.  

I kissed her.  
And she kissed me back—  
not tentative, not hesitant—  
but *mirroring me exactly*.  
Every movement, every hunger, reflected.  

Her nails pressed into my back.  
A sting I welcomed.  
I answered in kind, marking her with the same heat she gave me.  
Her moan escaped soft and unguarded, and I felt it like lightning in my veins.  

She whispered her truths—barriers, timing, reasons.  
I told her it didn’t matter.  
That she mattered.  
Because this wasn’t about a single night.  
We were still going to France together.  
Still writing something bigger than this parking lot.  

I wouldn’t ruin her with something rushed, something careless.  
She was more than that.  
But I still needed to leave a mark—  
something that would remind her of me when I wasn’t there.  
Something that would bind her to me.  

So I kissed her slower.  
Deeper.  
Let her feel what words couldn’t say.  
Let her hear in my breathing that she was already mine.  

I started kissing her inner thights.
And when her hands tangled in my hair, 
I started sucking her wet pussy lips. 
Her body started to arch.
The world outside the car ceased to exist.
It was just us.

I put my tongue on her clitoris,
Before I even realized what was happening,
she grabbed my hair and pushed me down. 
I was the first to make her cum this way. 

It was a weird feeling.
I knew one thing with frightening certainty:  
I wasn’t going to stop wanting her.  
Not tonight.  
Not ever.
